# Pass-A-Bot--reddit-Bot
A project by Jaxnif


The purpose of this bot was to be a learning experience and to get myself acquainted with PRAW. The bot functions as follows:

Once a target is chosen and the bot is deployed it will stalk the chosen user. It will then comment on every comment that this user makes, these responses can be tailored by hotwords found in the body of the comment.
I never finished the hotword process to its fullest potential; as in, I did not make a full list of hotwords and corresponding responses. This is something someone can do on their own should they choose for some reason to deploy my bot.

If a user mentions another user in their comment the bot will automatically stop following the first user and start following the second user, and so the chain begins.

The point of the bot was to have funny and creative responses to users comments. IE: a gif of a cat if the user mentions a cat in their comment.

I am too lazy to make a full list of hotwords and tailored responses so I have chosen not to deploy the bot. I learned how to use PRAW and the bot works and so I am happy with these results.
